## Idea

Recently I have taken up programming games using the RayLib library, and want to develop more complex games. So far I've developed a Minesweeper clone, a Conway's game of life simulator and a Tetris clone. Although I am satisfied with these projects, I feel I'd like to go further in developing a larger game since my previous projects weren't too complicated and needed little optimisation. I have the idea of creating a space shooter type game with sandbox like mechanics found in games like Noita. Style-wise, I would like it to be remeniscant of vector based arcade games going back to Astoroids. One game that comes to mind as inspiration is Geometry Wars games as I have fond memories of playing Geometry Wars Galaxies as a child on the Nintendo DS.

## Goals

A few aspects of the game I'd like to work on are:

 - A variety of enemy types with custom AI and properties

 - Customisable weapons

 - Strategic and fast paced gameplay for different enemies, areas, etc.

## Implementation

Previously, games I have worked on have been written in C with the raylib library targeting Linux as a platform. While C may now be one of my stronger languages, I think it may become a problem as the game scales up. I have decided that C++'s support for OOP makes it more suitable for a larger project.
